## 1. Introduction to HTML

 1.1. HTML
 - HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a text-based markup language for structuring electronic documents such as text with hyperlinks, images and other content. HTML documents are the basis of the World Wide Web and are displayed by web browsers. In addition to the content displayed by the browser, HTML files can contain additional details in the form of meta information, e.g. about the languages used in the text, the author or the summarized content of the text --> [W3C](https://www.w3.org/)

 1.2. Different types of websites
  * Web presence (Homepage / Corporate Website)
    - can be a private homepage or a web presence of companies, associations, authorities or business persons
    - for companies, municipalities and non-profit organizations it is often called a corporate website
    - many small companies and private persons use ready-made systems such as *WordPress* (content management system)

  * Blog / online magazine / portfolio
    - a website with usually chronologically sorted entries, which are separated from each other
    - can also be the start page of a website to display the latest articles or current information
    - online magazines can also be structured in this way
    - many companies and private persons often use ready-made systems like e.g., *WordPress* or *Drupal*
    - there are different blog types e.g. *corporate blog* (official company blog), *microblogging* (Twitter)
    - the installation of a blog software (e.g. *WordPress*) is flexible, because the blog can be extended with many templates and modules
    - portfolio websites are well suited for designers, photographers, artists and creatives, often website themes with minimalistic design
   - Knowledge of PHP and MySQL is an advantage but not necessary when using e.g. [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com) or [tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com)
