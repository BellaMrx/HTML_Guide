## 1. Introduction to HTML

### 1.1. Different types of websites
  * **Web presence (Homepage / Corporate Website)**
    - can be a private homepage or a web presence of companies, associations, authorities or business persons
    - for companies, municipalities and non-profit organizations it is often called a corporate website
    - many small companies and private persons use ready-made systems such as *WordPress* (Content-Management-System)

  * **Blog / online magazine / portfolio**
    - a website with usually chronologically sorted entries, which are separated from each other
    - can also be the start page of a website to display the latest articles or current information
    - online magazines can also be structured in this way
    - many companies and private persons often use ready-made systems like e.g., *WordPress* or *Drupal*
    - there are different blog types e.g. *corporate blog* (official company blog), *microblogging* (Twitter)
    - the installation of a blog software (e.g. *WordPress*) is flexible, because the blog can be extended with many templates and modules
    - portfolio websites are well suited for designers, photographers, artists and creatives, often website themes with minimalistic design
    - Knowledge of PHP and MySQL is an advantage but not necessary when using e.g. [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com) or [tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com) 

  * **E-commerce websites**	
    - in practice, one uses ready-made software, since the effort is less to update or maintain production catalog, and more importantly are much more secure especially with payment transactions
    - with ready-made software, an online store can be set up quite quickly, but there is a long list of legal requirements that must be observed (imprint obligation, terms and conditions, cancellation policy, information on delivery times and prices, etc.)
    - depending on the range of functions, an online store can be expensive, from complete solutions offered by hosting providers to professional webshop software to be installed on a server or webspace
    - frequently used software: Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce or Shopware

  * **Landing page / Microsite**
    - usually consists of only one web page, e.g. to start a test phase for a product
    - the goal is to present all the elements of the product to the visitors of the website, so that they become potential customers
    - such pages are highly optimized for search engines

  * **Web platform - social networks**
    - functionality is often provided by a content management system, typical social network platforms are e.g. Facebook, MySpace or so-called Wiki software
    - in the commercial area a better customer oriented support can be achieved
    - basic idea is that the content of registered users is extended with pictures, texts or graphics etc. to offer a collection of information, as the content is created by the users a moderation is necessary to check and manage the content

  * **Web apps**
    - these are Internet applications with many interaction possibilities, such as a common desktop application
    - such applications do not necessarily have to run in a web browser
    - Advantages can be an improved use and also a faster Perfomance


### 1.2. Dynamic and static websites
  * **Static websites**
    - the complete content such as texts, image data is stored unchanged in individual files on the web server
    - the content of such a file is created with HTML
    - in case of changes, the files usually have to be changed manually on the local computer and then uploaded to the webserver again
    - worthwhile for smaller web presences, where changes are rarely necessary 

  * Advantages:
    - costs are lower because no special features (databases, scripting languages) are needed
    - page load and load time may be faster, because page can be returned immediately from the web server as an response to the request
    - Development can be easier and cheaper, but it depends on the size of the project and the knowledge of the user

  * Disadvantages:
    - good knowledge of HTML and co. necessary to update website
    - creation of many single files for static website can be very time consuming


 ![Preview](Images/staticWebsite.PNG)

 This is a simplified representation of how a static web page is returned. The web browser first sends a request for a web page to the web server that hosts the web page. The web server finds the page and sends it back to the web server as a response. If it is not found, an error message is returned (status code 404).


  * **Dynamic websites**
    - usually a CMS (Content-Management-System) generates the web pages.
    - content like text and images are usually kept separate from the technical elements like layout or scripting
    - a CMS must be installed in a web server environment to be able to use previously installed script languages like PHP or Python and usually databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL

  * Advantages:
    - updating content and adding new content can be done much more quickly via a web-based user interface.
    - design changes can be made in one central place, usually many templates are available for this purpose, the changes affect all existing web pages at the same time
    - can be maintained without HTML and other programming skills
    - can be managed by several people
    - new functionalities can be added at any time with modules/plug-ins

  * Disadvantages:
    - there are higher costs, because special features like script languages and databases are needed, but not as expensive as a few years ago
    - for creating own modules and plug-ins programming skills are necessary


 ![Preview](Images/dynWebsite.PNG)

 This is a simplified representation of how a dynamic web page is created. A web browser makes a request for a web page to a web server. The web server finds the page and passes it to the application server. The application server searches the page for commands and completes the web page. Additionally, instructions for database queries may be included. The database driver then returns the requested record to the application server, where the data is inserted into the web page. The web page is then sent as a response to the web browser.


### 1.3. Programming languages for web development
  * This is an overview of the programming language that a web developer must know.

  * **HTML** (Hypertext Markup Language)
    - is a text-based markup language for structuring electronic documents such as text with hyperlinks, images and other content. HTML documents are the basis of the World Wide Web and are displayed by web browsers. In addition to the content displayed by the browser, HTML files can contain additional details in the form of meta information, e.g. about the languages used in the text, the author or the summarized content of the text --> [W3C](https://www.w3.org/)

  
  * **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets)
    - It is a design and formatting language used to determine the appearance of HTML documents. So it's about design or style, not the content of a web page. In practice, HTML is used only for structuring the web page, and CSS for formatting and styling. It is possible to include CSS directly in HTML. For large or more web pages it is advantageous to save this in a CSS file, then all web pages can be changed with once.

  * **JavaScript**
    - is the most important client-side scripting language, allowing to extend the limited possibilities of HTML with user interactions

  * **Server-side scripting languages and databases**
	  - common languages for dynamic websites are Python, PHP, Ruby etc., and for databases e.g. MySQL or PostgreSQL
	  - Knowledge in PHP and MySQL can be an advantage for e.g. formmails, guestbooks or surveys


### 1.4. Software for the creation and presentation of web pages
  * Basically, on every operating system there is a text editor for creating web pages and a browser for displaying the web page.
	  - Windows: Notepad
	  - Linux: e.g. gEdit
	  - Mac: TextEdit 

  * Most web developers use special editors, the advantage is on the one hand the syntax highlighting and many other helpful functions for the creation of web pages.
    - Visual Studio Code --> [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (My choice)
    - Adobe Brackets --> [Adobe Brackets](https://brackets.io/) 
    - Atom --> [Atom](https://atom.io/) 
    - Sublime Text --> [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) 
    - Notepad++ --> for beginners 

  * For the display of the HTML document you need a web browser. For testing it is best to use several web browsers, because there are small differences. You should also test the web pages on different devices, such as desktop computer, laptop, tablet and smartphone. In the best case, the display of the website adapts to the devices. This adaptability is called responsive web design. This adaptation does not happen automatically.
	  - the main web browsers currently are (largest mart share): Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari (Apple) and Edge (Microsoft).
	  - Other web browsers (smaller market share): Vivaldi, Opera, Brave 

  * The HTML renderer (browser engine) converts the source code into a visible web page.
    
    | Renderer  | Browser                                                     |
    | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Quantum   | Firefox                                                     |
    | Webkit    | Safari and all web browsers on iOS                          |
    | Blink     | Chrome, Edge, Samsung Internet, Vivaldi, Opera, Brave etc.  |

  * Create a web page and display it in the web browser 


### 1.5. Create and view a simple web page
  1. open an editor (for the beginning a simple editor is enough), and create a new empty document.
  2. enter HTML code into the editor, see folder --> *1_IntroductionToHTML/Part_A/index.html*
  3. save HTML code, it is recommended to create a new directory for it. When saving the file, make sure that the file is saved with the file extension *.html*. As encoding *UTF-8* is always good, you can also use *ANSI* for the time being.
  4. The HTML file can now be opened with a browser, usually it is enough to double-click the file and the standard browser opens and displays the file.

 * **Check HTML-Code**.
   - Whether the HTML code or the web page is correct, you can check it, with the online tool  at W3C[Validator](http://validator.w3.org) you can validate the code (in many editors such a function is available or can be integrated later)
   - if the code is error free a green bar is displayed (W3C)
   - If the validation is invalid, the error is listed with a message. An error output does not mean that the web page cannot be displayed, because the web browsers are relatively error tolerant, but it can lead to errors.
   - Many large websites have errors, hardly any site is 100% error free.

 * Advantages to validate the HTML code:
   - the correct display in all browsers, the browsers are relatively error-tolerant but there are differences, especially with mobile devices you should pay attention to it
   - Search engines look for texts and keywords, so that it can be found more easily
   - Accessible websites, incorrect text or structure can cause assistive tools such as read aloud software to not work properly.
   - helpful for beginners to recognize errors quickly and prevents writing unclean code --> a clean code shows quality
